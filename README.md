The Multi-Repo Tool is a command-line utility designed to simplify the management of multiple repositories within a team. It let's you define
* a **list of team repositories** that are cloned automatically, 
* **setup scripts**, that are executed automatically, after cloning the repositories,
* **githooks/rules across multiple or for single repositories** such as JIRA-ID based prefixes for commit messages and/or blocking branches for committing and pushing,
* and **automation scripts**, that you can run easily on your machine or in your CI/CD pipeline.
