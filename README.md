# Multi Repository Tool

The *Multi Repository Tool* is a command-line utility designed to streamline the management of multiple repositories within a team. It allows you to:

- Automatically clone a predefined list of team repositories.
- Automatically execute custom setup scripts (aka *setup commands*).
- Manage Git hooks and rules across multiple or individual repositories, such as enforcing JIRA-ID based prefixes for commit messages or restricting commits and pushes to specified branches.
- Effortlessly execute automation scripts (aka *run commands*) on your local machine or within your CI/CD pipeline.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install the Multi-Repo Tool on your machine:

1. Navigate to the [Releases](https://github.com/janisZisenis/multi-repo-tool/releases) section of the repository.
2. Download the appropriate binary for your platform.
3. Make it executable.

You can achieve all of the steps above by running the script below:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

detect_os() {
    local OS
    unameOut="$(uname -s)"
    case "${unameOut}" in
        Linux*)     OS=linux;;
        Darwin*)    OS=darwin;;
        *)          OS="UNKNOWN:${unameOut}"
    esac
    echo "${OS}"
}

detect_arch() {
    local ARCH
    archOut="$(uname -m)"
    case "${archOut}" in
        x86_64)    ARCH=amd64;;
        aarch64)   ARCH=arm64;;
        arm64)     ARCH=arm64;;
        *)         ARCH="UNKNOWN:${archOut}"
    esac
    echo "${ARCH}"
}

OS=$(detect_os)
ARCH=$(detect_arch)

curl -L -o mrt https://github.com/janisZisenis/multi-repo-tool/releases/download/latest/mrt-$OS-$ARCH

chmod +x mrt
```

4. Add the binary's location to your PATH variable by running

```sh
    export PATH=$PATH:<path/to/binary>
```

5. Verify that mrt is in your PATH by running:

```sh
mrt --version
```

## The Team Folder

The team folder is a crucial element for organizing and managing your team's repositories using the *Multi-Repo Tool*. It defines the execution path for the command-line tool and serves as the central location for the team configuration file (team.json).

Whenever you execute the command line tool make sure you are in the team folder or you added the *--team-dir* flag as shown below. The passed argument to this flag also decides where the command line tool searches for the configuration file as well as the setup and run commands.

```sh
  mrt <subcommand> --team-dir <path-to-team-dir>
```

Since the team folder is home to the team configuration file as well as scripts, that define key automations, it should be version-controlled itself.

## The Setup Flow

The *Multi Repository Tool* provides a *setup flow* that assists you in setting up your developer machine. Part of this flow is
  1. cloning the team's repositories,
  2. installing git-hooks to the cloned repositories,
  3. and executing custom setup commands.

You can execute the setup flow by running the following command in your teams folder.

```sh
mrt setup all
```

#### Skipping setup steps

You can also skip parts of the flow by adding the respective skip flag as shown below.

```sh
mrt setup all \
  --skip-clone-repositories \
  --skip-install-git-hooks
```

Also the custom setup command come with a skip flag. If you define a setup command named *install-tools* a respective skip flag *skip-install-tools* exists.

#### Execute specific setup steps

Additionally, it is also possible to execute single steps of the setup flow. To do so specify the name of the step instead of the *all* subcommand as in the following examples.

```sh
mrt setup clone-repositories
mrt setup install-git-hooks
mrt setup install-tools
```

### Clone your team's repositories

To specify which repositories to clone during the setup flow, create a `team.json` configuration file. The configuration file should contain a list of your repositories as shown below:

```json
{
  "repositories": [
    "git@github.com:repository1.git",
    "git@github.com:repository2.git",
    "...",
  ]
}
```

With the repositories array in the team configuration file, the setup flow will automatically clone the specified repositories to a *repositories* folder next to your `team.json`.

If you want to change the location of the repositories, you can set the new repositories path in your team configuration file as shown below. The specified path can be relative or absolute.

```json
{
  "repositoriesPath": "path/to/repository"
  "repositories": [
    "..."
  ]
}
```

### Remove your team prefixes

Sometimes, teams in a bigger organization add prefixes to their repository names. To keep a better overview of the cloned repositories on your machine, you can remove your team's prefix(es) from the repository names while cloning by specifying them in the team configuration file.

```json
{
  "repositoriesPrefixes": [
    "team_prefix1",
    "team_prefix2",
    "..."
  ]
}
```

### Add custom setup commands

Commonly, before a new developer in the team can start to develop, they need to follow some setup steps â€“ usually documented in a documentation tool such as Confluence. 

> Examples:
> - Installing tools
> - downloading and installing VPN certificates
> - setup AWS configuration file
> - ...

Unfortunately, this documentation gets out of date easily complicating the setup for the new team member.

The *Multi Repository Tool* allows you to implement custom setup *commands*. Each command consists of a command file (an executable file named "command"), which is located in a the command folder. The name of the command is specified by the name of the command folder. Once you add the command folder to the predefined path *./setup* in the team folder the *Multi Repository Tool* can find and execute them as part of the setup flow.

Below you can see an example folder structure:

```
/team-folder
  |-- team.json
  |-- repositories
  |   |-- ...
  |-- setup
  |   |-- install-tools
  |   |   |-- command
  |   |-- setup-aws
  |   |   |-- command
```

With the folder structure above in place you can run the following code snippet to execute the custom setup commands.

```sh
  mrt setup install-tools
  mrt setup setup-aws
```

## Let git hooks assist you

Once you installed the git-hooks using the setup flow, the *Multi Repository Tool* provides a convenient way to add tasks that run as part of a git-hook.

>Currently, the *Multi Repository Tool* only supports the following git-hooks:
>- commit-msg
>- pre-commit
>- post-commit

When you perform some actions in your repositories (e.g. committing/pushing) the respective git-hooks are called. These git-hooks execute the tool's `git-hook` subcommand passing their git-hook name (e.g. pre-commit/pre-push) and their repository's root path.

Delegating the execution of the git-hook to the *Multi Repository Tool* allows to add automated rules across all the repositories located in your `repositoriesPath` such as blocking branches and prefixing the commit messages. 

> Because the git-hooks need a direct link to the team folder, you need to re-install the git-hooks when the team folder is relocated. To re-install the git-hooks run the following command.
>```sh
>mrt setup install-git-hooks
>```

### Block your most important branches

To block committing and pushing on certain branches add a `blockedBranches` array to your team configuration file as shown below. With this array in place committing and pushing on the specified branches will fail.

```json
{
  "repositories": [
    "..."
  ],
  "blockedBranches": [
    "main",
    "dev"
  ]
}
```

### Prefix your commit messages

Often, teams use a ticketing systems such as JIRA. To keep a good overview of which commit is implemented as part of which ticket, the *Multi Repository Tool* assists you in prefixing your commit message with the ticket number (or JIRA Issue Id). This is also a prerequisite to enable JIRA Smart Commits (see [here](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/use-smart-commits/)).

To ensure your commit messages are prefixed correctly you can add a regular expression to your team configuration file as shown below.

```json
{
  "repositories": [
    "..."
  ],
  "commitPrefixRegex": "ABCD-[0-9]+"
}
```

Whenever you try to commit with a message not having a prefix conforming to the regular expression followed by a colon and a space, the commit will fail.

> **Example**:<br>
> Valid commit message: "ABCD-99:&nbsp;Some Commit". <br>
> Invalid commit message: "Some commit".

You can add the prefix manually to the commit message, or let the *Multi Repository Tool* take care of it. To use the tool's automation add the ticket number to the branch's name. Based on the given regular expression the tool will parse the first matching substring from the branch name and use it as prefix for your commit message.

In case you have the ticket number in your branch name and provide another one manually while comitting, the manual passed ticket number has priority.

> **Exception**: Merge commits<br>
> The prefix rule does not apply to merge commits. Even with a `commitPrefixRegex` in the team configuration file merge commits are not validated and do not need to be prefixed. Merge commits are detected by commit messages starting with "Merge branch" or "Merge remote-tracking branch".

### Add custom hook scripts

In each repository you might want to add some additional tasks if you perform a certain action in the repository (e.g. linting your code before committing). The *Multi Repository Tool* allows you to add executable scripts to the predefined path *./hook-scripts/\<git-hook-name\>* within the respective repository's root folder.

Below you can see an example folder structure:

```l
/repository-root-folder
  |-- .git
  |-- <your-sources>
  |-- hook-scripts
  |   |-- pre-commit
  |   |   |-- preCommitTask1
  |   |   |-- ...
  |   |-- pre-push
  |   |   |-- prePushTask1
  |   |   |-- ...
```
